\arguments{
\item{iterations}{The number of replicate iterations to generate.}

\item{cores}{Amount of cores that are to be assigned to CINsim. Defaults to 2.}

\item{karyotypes}{A single matrix or list of matrices with cells in rows and chromosomes in colums. Rows and colums must be labelled appropriately.}

\item{euploid_ref}{The euploid chromosome copy number (used for calculating levels of aneuploidy).}

\item{g}{The maximum number of generations to be simulated.}

\item{pMisseg}{The mis-segregation probability per chromosome copy. Can be multiple to loop over.}

\item{pWGD}{The probability of a cell undergoing whole-genome duplication instead of a normal mitosis}

\item{pMissegG}{A vector of generation numbers during which pMisseg is set at the desired values. Will otherwise be consistent.}

\item{fit_misseg}{A logical whether pMisseg should be fitness-dependent.}

\item{pDivision}{The base probability of cell division.}

\item{fit_division}{A logical whether pDivision should be karyotype (i.e. fitness) dependent.}

\item{copy_num_boundaries}{A minimum and maximum number of copy numbers allowed per chromosome before a cell is deemed unviable.}

\item{selection_mode}{One of three possible modes, "cn_based", "rel_copy", "davoli", for copy number-based, relative copy numbed-based or Davoli-based selection.}

\item{selection_metric}{A fitness metric for the cn_based, rel_copy or davoli selection measure. Usually the observed karyotype frequencies from your data}

\item{coef}{coefficients for alternative values of pMisseg, pSurvival & pDivision. Can be created by the (make_cinsim_coefficients) function}

\item{chrom_weights}{An optional vector of chromosome weights to affect cellular fitness.}

\item{qMods}{A single vector or list of vectors of length 3 to modify the calculated values for pDivison, pMisseg and pSurvival respectively.}

\item{max_monosomy}{The minimum number of monosomies that will cause the cell to die.}

\item{min_euploid}{The minimum number of euploid chromosomes that must remain before the cell dies.}

\item{down_sample}{The maximum size of the simulated population before down-sampling.}

\item{down_sample_frac}{The fraction of cells with which to continue the simulation after down-sampling.}

\item{max_num_cells}{The maximum number of (theoretical) cells to simulate before the simulation is terminated.}

\item{collect_fitness_score}{A logical whether to collect the fitness scores over time.}

\item{CnFS}{Boolean to indicate whether the CnFS should be calculated, defaults to TRUE}

\item{KMS}{Boolean to indicate whether the KMS should be calculated, defaults to FALSE}

\item{final_aneu_het_scores}{The final population measures (heterogeneity & aneuploidy) required for calculating the KMS.}
